Configuration:
--------------
You can configure TUI in several ways.
It is highly recomended to configure it first using:
	su -c tui
	
After that is done, users may start to apply their own configuration.
	tui


However, you may access the files directly as well,
you will find them at these places:

Systemwide settings are located in:	/etc/tui
User template configuration file:	/usr/share/tui
User configuration actualy is in:	$HOME/.config/tui



Until the regarding commands are supplied by TUI, 
it will only open the configuration files in your set editor.

The TUI defaults are stored in /etc/tui/tui.conf,
system administrators may change system wide settings there.
Its suggested to not edit the file! ;)

Users may do change the file ~/.config/tui/user.conf, 
once they have copied it from /usr/share/tui/user.conf

However, just call 'tui' in your terminal and it will ask
to open the configuration file according to your userlevel.

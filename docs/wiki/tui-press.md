### tui-press

Description:
------------

This user interaction : script  is ment to be used as some sort of breakpoint.

Give the user a minute to breath and read whats there written in the terminal.

This is helpfull for loop-based menus if an output is to be read before showing the menu again.


Examples:
---------
A default call of:

	tui-press
	
Will look like:

	# | Press [ENTER] to continue                  Press [ENTER] to continue | #
	
And obviously expects the user to press ENTER before the script continues.

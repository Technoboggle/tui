README - 0.4.0
==============

Description:
------------
TUI is an abrevihation for Textual User Interface
It enables you to write scripts simulation a TUI
in Emergency, Multiuser and Graphical stages.
Furthermore, the TUI will work in bash, csh and 
zsh too as its written in sh.

This package provides multiple commands (tui*)
available in the shell.
Those commands are thought to be used in your scripts, 
'replacing' other/some calls of 'echo' and/or 'printf'.
They will give you the opportunity to place strings left,
center or right aligned.



Purpose:
------------
In todays world, everything is about presenting.
There are many tasks that can be faster accomplished 
using a script rather than writing an application for
it as others require to use it.

This said, it is known many end-users dont like the terminal screen.
That is usualy because the commands in terminals have their 
output not very well structured, usualy just text-by-text-by-newline-by-text.

This is if you need/want/have to provide scripts for users to use,
and make it (a little) easier for them to 'read' the terminal,
without to have to write 'presentation' handlers.

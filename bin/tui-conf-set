Usage: 		$ME [options] FILE VALUENAME [VALUE]
Examples:	$ME -l  /etc/default/grub 			| Prints a list of found variable-names
		$ME     /etc/default/grub GRUB_TIMEOUT 15	| Saves VALUENAME as passed (VALUENAME)
		$ME -ic /etc/default/grub grub_timeout 15	| Saves valuename as VALUENAME
		$ME -i  /etc/default/grub grub_timeout 15	| Saves valuename as passed (valuename)
		$ME -is /etc/default/grub GRUB_TIMEOUT 15	| Saves VALUENAME as valuename
		
Where options are:
	-h		This screen
	-i		Internal search pattern is no longer case sensitive
	-l		Lists values vailabel in the file
	-c		Writes the VALUE, and stores VALUENAME in capital chars
	-s		Writes the VALUE, and stores VALUENAME in lower chars
